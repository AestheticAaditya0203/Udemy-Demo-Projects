            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the <i>red junglefowl</i>, with
            attributes of wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Asia">Southeastern Asia</a>.
            Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
            that has
            been cast
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
            the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source
            of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
        </p>
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called
            a 'hen'.</p>

        <p>Other terms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken</li>
            <li>'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male chicken</li>
            <li>'Chick:' a young chicken</li>
            <li>'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)</li>
            <li>'Cockerel:' a young male chicken less than a year old </li>
            <li>'Dunghill fowl:' a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties. </li>
            <li> 'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a
                sexually immature chicken less than <sup><a href="http://www.youtube.com">22</a></sup>weeks of age.
            </li>
            <li>'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal) </li>
            <li> "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However,
                thanks
                to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in
                general, especially in American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically
                referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'. </li>
            <li>'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).</li>

        <h2>General Biology and Habitat</h2>
        <p>Chickens are omnivores.In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects,
            and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30]

            The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[31] The world's oldest known
            chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[32]

            Eggs from different breeds
            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
            shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of
            brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as
            the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the
            hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development
            of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks
            may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb,
            or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.
            Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
            Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more
            prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which
            causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[33]

            Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally
            capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees
            (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their
            surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.</p>
